# Smart-Distance-Alert
This project is a simple ultrasonic range finder system built using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), an OLED display, an RGB LED, and a buzzer to provide real-time distance measurements and visual/audio feedback. The system uses the ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an object and displays the value on an OLED screen
